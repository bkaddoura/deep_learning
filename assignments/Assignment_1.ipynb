For this assignment, it's strongly recommended that you use a GPU to accelerate your training, or else you might find it difficult to train your network in a reasonable amount of time. If you have a computer with a GPU that you wish to use, you can follow the [TensorFlow instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) for installing TensorFlow with GPU support. Otherwise, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to complete this assignment. Colab provides free access to GPU-enabled machines.
