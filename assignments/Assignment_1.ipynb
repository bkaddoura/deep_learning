        "In this graded assignment, you will be asked to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. At each step, you'll be guided through the process of developing a model architecture to solve a problem. Your goal is to create a CNN that attains at least 55% accuracy on the validation set.\n",

        "The [CIFAR-100 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 500 images from each class.\n",

        "You will use Keras with TensorFlow to develop your CNN. For this assignment, it's strongly recommended that you use a GPU to accelerate your training, or else you might find it difficult to train your network in a reasonable amount of time. If you have a computer with a GPU that you wish to use, you can follow the [TensorFlow instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) for installing TensorFlow with GPU support. Otherwise, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to complete this assignment. Colab provides free access to GPU-enabled machines. If you run into any issues, please make sure to email us as soon as possible so that we can help you resolve them."
